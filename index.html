            <blockquote>Play long-term games with long-term people.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes — train and sprint, then rest and reassess.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The fundamental delusion — there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Success is the enemy of learning. It can deprive you of the time and the incentive to start over.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Money doesn't buy happiness - it buys freedom.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The more seriously you take yourself, the unhappier you're going to be.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Life is a single player game. You're born alone. You're going to die alone. All your interpretations are alone.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The quality of your mind is the quality of your life.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>To write a great book, you must first become the book.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with them for a day.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Information is everywhere but its meaning is created by the observer that interprets it. Meaning is relative and there is no objective, over-arching meaning.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Technology is not only the thing that moves the human race forward, but it's the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we're just monkeys playing in the dirt.</blockquote>
